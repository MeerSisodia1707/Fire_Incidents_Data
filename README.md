# Trends in Fire Accidents in Toronto
## About
I have examined the data on reported fire incidents from 2011 to 2022 in the city of Toronto that the Ontario Fire Marshal made available in this analysis. After analysing the trend of incidents from 2011 to 2022, I discovered an unanticipated increase in incidents between 2017 and 2018. Additionally, we have examined the pattern of incidents over the course of several months from 2011 to 2022.We have also tried to understand the distribution of number of deaths and ignition sources of fire incidents.
